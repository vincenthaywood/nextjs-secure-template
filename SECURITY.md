# Security & Vulnerability Management Guide

This template implements comprehensive security measures to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure safe deployments.

## 🔒 Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning
- ✅ **NPM Audit** - Dependency vulnerability checking
- ✅ **Snyk Security** - Advanced vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **GitHub CodeQL** - Static application security testing
- ✅ **Dependency Checks** - License compliance verification
- ✅ **Build Security** - Secret detection in artifacts

### Daily Monitoring
- 🕒 **Scheduled Scans** - Daily security checks at 2 AM UTC
- 📊 **Security Reports** - GitHub Security tab integration
- 🚨 **Automated Alerts** - Immediate critical vulnerability notifications

## 🛠️ Security Commands

### Quick Security Check
```bash
npm run security:check
```

### Full Security Audit
```bash
npm run security:full
```

### Individual Scans
```bash
npm run security:audit      # Vulnerability check
npm run security:deps       # Dependency audit
npm run security:licenses   # License compliance
npm run security:snyk       # Snyk scan (requires token)
npm run lint:security       # Security linting
```

## 🚨 Vulnerability Response

### Severity Levels

#### Critical/High 🔴
- **Response**: Immediate (blocks deployment)
- **Actions**: Emergency fix required

#### Medium 🟡  
- **Response**: Within 1 week
- **Actions**: Plan remediation

#### Low 🟢
- **Response**: Within 1 month
- **Actions**: Include in maintenance

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required GitHub Secrets
- `SNYK_TOKEN` (optional but recommended)
  - Get from: https://app.snyk.io/account
  - Enables advanced vulnerability scanning

### GitHub Security Features
- ✅ Dependabot alerts
- ✅ CodeQL scanning
- ✅ Secret scanning
- ✅ Security advisories

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Developers
1. Never commit secrets - use environment variables
2. Keep dependencies updated - regular `npm audit fix`
3. Review security alerts promptly
4. Follow ESLint security rules

### Deployment
1. Environment isolation
2. Minimal permissions
3. Regular security reviews
4. Incident response plan

## 📈 Security Metrics

Track these for security health:
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
- Vulnerability backlog
- Security test coverage

## 🆘 Emergency Response

### Critical Vulnerability Process
1. Stop deployments immediately
2. Assess production impact
3. Communicate to stakeholders
4. Apply emergency patch
5. Verify fix thoroughly
6. Deploy with monitoring
7. Post-incident review
